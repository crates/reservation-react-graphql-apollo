# Reservations demo - front-end

* React
* GraphQL (Apollo)
* MobX

## Considerations due to scope of demo

* Does not use animations
* Limited styling
* Limited error handling
* Does not use date libraries (i.e. moment.js) to format dates

## Running

1.  Update src/App.js ApolloClient's url with your app id from ../server/claudia.json
2.  `yarn install`
3.  `yarn start`
